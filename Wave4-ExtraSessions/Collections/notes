What are Collections ?
API -> help to store data in a particular data structure of your choice

1. List
2. Set 
3. Map


Interfaces -> set of rules that are given

List -> insert(), delete(), size(), count , ...... 

1. ArrayList - dynamic array 
10 -> 11 -> 50% in size 15 -> 16 -> .....
2. LinkedList - 


retrieving from the array list is quite easy, add/delete frequently -> db cache memory

add/delete functions -> shopping cart
